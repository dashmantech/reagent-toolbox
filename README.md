# Reagent Toolbox

A wrapper for [React Toolbox](http://react-toolbox.com/) using [cljsjs/react-toolbox](https://clojars.org/cljsjs/react-toolbox)
and [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/).

This is currently a work in progress and contributions are welcome. If you want to help, the [Reagent Toolbox Docs](https://github.com/dashmantech/reagent-toolbox-docs)
project is probably a good place to start.
 
[Reagent Toolbox Docs](https://github.com/dashmantech/reagent-toolbox-docs) is an attempt to replicate the excellent
playground/docs site React Toolbox has, but focusing on Reagent Toolbox, Reagent and ClojureScript. You can visit a
live version at http://reagent-toolbox-docs.dashman.tech/
